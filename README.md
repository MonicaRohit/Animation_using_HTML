# Animation_using_HTML
The birds are flying across the screen in a looping animation, while the people are cycling through the frame, moving up and down as they pedal. The dog is running in front of the cycling people, panting as it goes. All of these movements  gives the impression of a lively, active scene.
Used HTML to create a canvas element where the animation will be displayed.
Used CSS to define the styles for the canvas element, including its size and position.
Used CSS to define the styles for the objects in the animation, such as the birds, people, and dog. We could use CSS transforms and transitions to make them move and animate.
